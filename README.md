## Overview âœˆ 

I use Github mostly for hosting my personal website and keeping track of little projects over time. There's some older repositories in here that have to do with learning programming, because back in the day I used to be a pharmaceutical chemist and I made a career change into programming. I gave a talk about it at one point titled [From Chemist to Software Engineer in 5 Months](https://kellylin.me/files/Chemist_to_Software_Engineer.pdf).

If you're going through a career change and could use a sympathetic ear, I'm here for you.

Hit me up via the email on my website. 

Other topics I'm happy to talk about:

- mentorship in software engineering
- the search for passion 
- drawing
- music composition or production
- game jams and game development
- writing
- fitness and nutrition
- science fiction novels
- climbing (only a smidgen)
